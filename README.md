JavaFX / Maven Example
======================

I'm trying to always learn new stuff by writing about it over at http://slothsoft.de/

Since ZIP files are a bit unflexible and somewhat annoying to handle I want to put the source code for my tutorials
in this GIT repository.

This example shows how to create Hello World application using JavaFX and Maven. A step by step description can be found here: http://slothsoft.de/node/105
